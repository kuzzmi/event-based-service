Tinkering a monolith service that has is designed using internal messaging-based
architecture. Want to use this to explore some ideas, concepts and thoughts.

Components:
1. Objects repository - abstraction to access Objects using Repository pattern
1. Notifications service - listens to messages and builds notifications to be sent
1. Notifier service - sends messages
1. Payment service - manages payments (mocked of course)

Nothing interesting, but for some, might be useful.
